	okay so this one is a little tricky and experimental, let me explain:
	We draw a map of the player's surroundings, sounds easy right ? Wrong.
	Because we're on a command line, we're drawing stuff up to down.
	So we need to know if we're drawing the room on the player's north, if yes, draw it.
	The size of the "boxes" of the rooms will be determined by the length of the name of the room +2, 
	so it's nicely centered and stuff.
	Then we need to know if we're drawing the room at the left, if yes, 
	we need to move the room to the north first, etc, etc...

	See why it's complicated ?

	I plan to (try to) implement this in the v0.4.0, but not before.
