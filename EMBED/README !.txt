Hi, I'm Sandai, and this is my new project called "Tale of Delamar".
This is a playtest build, so here's a list of what you can or cannot do in this build :
- The debug flag is enabled, this will print useless messages for you, but useful for me.
- You may need to install the programs named "vcredist...", it's the C++ libraries that keep the game from self-destruct.

I think I've listed what you have to keep in mind while playing it.
Oh, and I almost forgot : 

- REPORT THE BUGS !1!!!
- You *need* to report the bugs by making a new issue here : https://github.com/Sandaidev/TaleOfDelamar/issues
- I know some of you might report them to me directly on discord, I've done that before, it's a shitshow to maintain.
- So report them on GitHub, m'kay ?

Have fun testing the core of the game !
- Sandai
